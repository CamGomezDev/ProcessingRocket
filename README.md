# ProcessingRocket

This projects consists in the simulation of a rocket landing with its physics engine written from scratch, and the graphics implemented in Java/Processing. It accompanies this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wjDc5qQASQ

The project was completely implemented in IntelliJ IDEA (not in the Processing editor) with Processing being called as an external library, alongside the Efficient Java Matrix Library (EJML), for some matrix multiplications that were needed.

To run it just clone or download the repository, open in IntelliJ, add both of the librarires in libs (all of the jar files) as External libraries to the project, may need to set it as a Java 11 project, and run normally. Shouldn't be too hard. If there's any problem just let me know in the Issues.

For controlling the rocket:  
K: main thrust  
J-L: left and right boosters  
I-M: other two boosters  
A-S-D-W: moving camera  
R: restart
